# controlpanel-documentation-web
added ControlPanel documentation for LIferay

See https://youtu.be/HixDZgnexY8 for the effect of this proof of concept.

Needs *a lot* of actual content, currently only basic documentation and 
many placeholders are available. Content is maintained externally and 
dynamically embedded through iframes from a frequently updated server 
(nontracking).
