directory-for-generated-content-description=This plugin can bulk-generate Markdown templates and an updated content.json file to a directory. If you have configured it to generate content, this is where the content will be written to. Markdown will be written upon a page being accessed, while content.json is written once the bundle is shut down.
repository-url-prefix-description=Respository URL Prefix for generating "edit on github" links. Includes branch and root of the content files. Typically ends in a slash '/'
content-url-prefix-description=Content URL prefix (where you intend to publish the documentation to be included via iframe). This will be used in the generated content.json file and in generated Markdown files. Typically ends in a slash '/'
generate-content-description=Enable bulk content generation. Useful to get a large number of uniform pages generated. You should leave this disabled unless you start generating all those files again from scratch.

default-video-height-description=Some documentation has video elements. This setting sets the default size in which a video is displayed. Standard is 8em (M), the currently offered L and S sizes are 24 and 2em. Minimal value is 2 (or 0 to disable video) (This height only applies to video media, not youtube links)

default-doc-height=Default Documentation height
default-doc-height-description=Links to documentation are shown in a slide-in iframe at the bottom of the screen. The default height is 4em, clicking "hide" shrinks it to 2em. Hardcoded minimal height is 1em, to disable the feature uninstall the plugin.

workaround-github-bug-description=Until at least January 2020 github had a bug that swallowed one directory level from the name of newly created files in a directory. If you submit new content, and discover them being created in an obvious WORKAROUND directory (named "github-bug-workaround-REMOVE-WHEN-FIXED"), github might have fixed their issue, and you can deactivate this plugin's workaround with this setting. Default is to workaround the issue, as this was the state during development/release of this plugin and no ETA was given by github (the bug is acknowledged)
workaround-github-bug=Workaround github (new file) bug
